class Word():
  def__init__(self, chosen_word):
    # this method will split the word up into a list of dictionaries with 2 attributes:
    # the letter/character, and a boolean representing whether or not it has been guessed

  # ...other methods here... (refer back to JS hangman for ideas -- may not translate exactly, but
  # should be close enough)


# some variables here to prepare the wordlist, initialize things like
# `remaining_guesses` (start a round with 8), `letters_used`, the `chosen_word` (randomly
# chosen from a list of words you also declare here perhaps?),
#and whatever else you might want to keep track of


# a loop here that will cause game to play and be exited when user either wins or loses
# see below for tips on how to structure this loop
